# Redux Expense Tracker

**The Redux-Expense-Tracker project showcases the use of Redux for state management in a React application. It focuses on managing expenses and income data through a structured state management approach. Redux, a predictable state container, helps maintain a single source of truth for the application's state, allowing consistent and traceable state changes. The project leverages Redux actions, reducers, and the store to handle complex state logic, making it easier to manage and debug state transitions related to financial transactions. This approach ensures a scalable and maintainable solution for handling application state.**

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Redux**: For state management, handling the expenses state.
- **React-Redux**: For integrating Redux with React, specifically using `useSelector` to access state.
- **React Icons**: For including icons in the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and layout.

## React Hooks Used

- **`useSelector`**: Retrieves the list of expenses from the Redux store.

## Redux Functions Used

- **`useDispatch`** (commented out): Intended for dispatching actions to modify the Redux store.
- **`useSelector`**: Selects data from the Redux store to be used in the component.
