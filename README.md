# Redux Expense Tracker

**The Redux-Expense-Tracker project showcases the use of Redux for state management in a React application. It focuses on managing expenses and income data through a structured state management approach. Redux, a predictable state container, helps maintain a single source of truth for the application's state, allowing consistent and traceable state changes. The project leverages Redux actions, reducers, and the store to handle complex state logic, making it easier to manage and debug state transitions related to financial transactions. This approach ensures a scalable and maintainable solution for handling application state.**
